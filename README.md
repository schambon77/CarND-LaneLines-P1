# **Finding Lane Lines on the Road** 

The Jupyter notebook P1 can be ran as is, and will generate (and save) the final pictures with full lines on test images .

It will also generate the videos with full lines superimposed.

The writeup is [here](https://github.com/schambon77/CarND-LaneLines-P1/blob/master/writeup.md).

Thanks and regards,

Sylvain
